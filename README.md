# MaterialClassification
Material Classification using deep convolutional neural networks 

We did all experiments via colab. All colab notebooks used are in this folder.

<MODEL>_training_<DATASET>.ipynb are the colab notebooks for training baseline model with framework name <MODEL> using dataset(s) with name(s) <DATASET>
<MODEL>_optimizing_<DATASET>.ipynb are the colab notebooks for optimizing(data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning) baseline model with framework name <MODEL> using dataset(s) with name(s) <DATASET>
obtain_fmd_minc_dataset.ipynb is the colab notebook used to set up the project folder on gdrive. It also provides codes and intructions on how to acquire, unzip and permanently save the FMD and MINC dataset to the project folder on Gdrive. This notebook should be run to set up the project before model training and optimization.
